::: {.notes}
Today, we‚Äôre diving into solutions architecture‚Äîaka the job where you solve big problems, draw fancy diagrams, and master the phrase 'It depends.' By the end of this, you‚Äôll see why I went from coding in the trenches to being the person who says, 'Well, maybe‚Ä¶' for a living

# Okay, but what do we actually do?

# Money üîÉ Servers
No, we're not wizards nor therapists...

::: {.notes}
Solutions architecture is like being a translator. Business folks say, 'Make us money!' Developers say, 'Gimme code!' My job? Figure out how to turn 'money' into 'servers' without anyone crying.

## A Day in the Life (1)

- Your friend walks in, believing they have come up with the next big thing in social media.
    - "We're gonna be the next TikTok, I just know it!" they say.

**What do you say?**

---

## A Day in the Life (2)

- Your client gives you a tour of their office. Turns out, their entire database lives on a single server running since 2005.
    - "Well, can we scale with this?" he asks.

**What do you say?**

---

## A Day in the Life (3)

- An executive from your client just came from a tech conference.
    - "I know what we need! More AI, blockchain, and quantum tech!" he proudly acclaims.

**What do you say?**

::: {.notes}
Solutions architects don‚Äôt just pick tech‚Äîwe weigh trade-offs: cost, speed, scalability, and how much the client will hate us later.

# The Formula
Problem ‚û°Ô∏è Budget? ‚û°Ô∏è Tech? ‚û°Ô∏è **"It Depends"** üü∞ üí∞ Profit

::: {.notes}
Saying 'It depends' isn‚Äôt a cop-out‚Äîit‚Äôs a superpower. It means I‚Äôm thinking about their problem, not just my favorite shiny tool. Do they need cheap? Fast? Future-proof? Yes, but also no‚Äîbecause trade-offs.

# Hands-on Activity 
Let's put what you've learned to the test!

## Case Briefer

Imagine this: It‚Äôs 11 p.m. 

You‚Äôre at your house, trying to submit your assignment before the deadline. 

- Your sibling's streaming Netflix
- Dad's outside the room gaming
- Mom's TikTok dance video just buffered for the third time

Your Wi-Fi? Dead. Your family looks at you in contempt.

You‚Äôre the solutions architect now. **What do you do?**

---

## Case Briefer (cont.)

- Problem: Wi-Fi‚Äôs slow or down
- Stakeholders: You and your family
- Constraints: PHP 1000 budget, no rewiring the house, 24-hour deadline
- Needs: Streaming, gaming, assignment uploads‚Äîall at once

---

## Mechanics

- Group yourselves randomly
    - The facilitator will handle this
- You have 15 minutes to come up with a solution
    - You must give your solution a witty name. This will be your team name
- Afterwards, each team gets 2 minutes max to present their solution
    - Convince the room (a.k.a. your family) why we should go with your idea

## So You Wanna Architect a Solution? {.center}
It depends... we'll figure it out in the cloud üòÖ

::: {.notes}
You don‚Äôt need to know everything‚Äîjust how to ask the right questions. Start small: next time your prof asks about a project, say, 'It depends,' and watch their face.
