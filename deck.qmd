Today, we’re diving into solutions architecture—aka the job where you solve big problems, draw fancy diagrams, and master the phrase 'It depends.' By the end of this, you’ll see why I went from coding in the trenches to being the person who says, 'Well, maybe…' for a living

# Okay, but do we actually do?

# Money 🔃 Servers
No, we're not wizards nor therapists...

::: {.notes}
Solutions architecture is like being a translator. Business folks say, 'Make us money!' Developers say, 'Gimme code!' My job? Figure out how to turn 'money' into 'servers' without anyone crying.

## A Day in the Life (1)

- Your friend walks in, believing they have come up with the next big thing in social media.
    - "We're gonna be the next TikTok, I just know it!" they say.

**What do you say?**

---

## A Day in the Life (2)

- Your client gives you a tour of their office. Turns out, their entire database lives on a single server running since 2005.
    - "Well, can we scale with this?" he asks.

**What do you say?**

---

## A Day in the Life (3)

- An executive from your client just came from a tech conference.
    - "I know what we need! More AI, blockchain, and quantum tech!" he proudly acclaims.

**What do you say?**

Solutions architects don’t just pick tech—we weigh trade-offs: cost, speed, scalability, and how much the client will hate us later.

# The Formula
Problem ➕ Budget? ➕ Tech? ➕ "It Depends" 🟰 💰 Profit

::: {.notes}
Saying 'It depends' isn’t a cop-out—it’s a superpower. It means I’m thinking about their problem, not just my favorite shiny tool. Do they need cheap? Fast? Future-proof? Yes, but also no—because trade-offs.

## So You Wanna Architect a Solution? {.center}
It depends... we'll figure it out in the cloud 😅

::: {.notes}
You don’t need to know everything—just how to ask the right questions. Start small: next time your prof asks about a project, say, 'It depends,' and watch their face.

# Hands-on Activity 
Let's put what you've learned to the test!

## Case Briefer

Imagine this: It’s 11 p.m. 

You’re at your house, trying to submit your assignment before the deadline. 

- Your roommate sibling's streaming Netflix
- Dad's outside the room gaming
- Mom's TikTok dance video just buffered for the third time

Your Wi-Fi? Dead. Your family looks at you in contempt.

You’re the solutions architect now. **What do you do?**

## Case Briefer (cont.)

- Problem: Wi-Fi’s slow or down
- Stakeholders: You and your family
- Constraints: PHP 1000 budget, no rewiring the house, 24-hour deadline
- Needs: Streaming, gaming, assignment uploads—all at once

## Mechanics

- You have 15 minutes to come up with a solution
    - You must give your solution a witty name. This will be your team name
- Afterwards, each group gets 2 minutes max to present your solution
    - Convince the room (a.k.a. your family) why we should go with your idea
- At the end, we will all vote on whose solution is the best
