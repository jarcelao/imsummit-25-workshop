Repo to store presentation files related to the talk "It Depends": What Solutions Architects Actually Do

## Setup

### Option 1: Dev Container Setup
This repository contains a `.devcontainer` configuration that sets up all dependencies for you. Simply launch this repo in a Codespace or use [VSCode's Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) to launch a dev container.

### Option 2: Local Setup
Before continuing, ensure that you have installed [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) on your system.

## Preview Deck

Once you have setup your environment, simply run `quarto preview deck.qmd` to launch the deck on a local web server.

Alternatively, a `deck.pdf` file is also provided for convenience. This was generated by using the PDF export mode in the local web server.

## References

This deck was written using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) with the [`revealjs`](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) format.
